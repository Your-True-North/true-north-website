# Content Folder

Place your writings, teachings, and content here as `.txt` or `.md` files.

The AI/DI system will automatically read all files in this folder and use them to inform responses in your authentic voice.

Example files to add:
- `core-teachings.md` - Your foundational principles
- `anger-work.md` - Your anger transformation process  
- `masculine-healing.md` - Your approach to masculine healing
- `circle-teachings.md` - Circle of Return content
- `personal-story.md` - Your transformation story
- `breathwork-guidance.md` - Breathwork principles

The more content you add here, the more authentic and detailed the AI responses will be.
